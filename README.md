# BF4PlayerStats
C# Desktop Application for Battlefield 4 Player Statistics

This repository contains 2 C# Projects. 

I created both these projects while I was starting to learn C#. 
NOTE
This 2 projects are not a reflection of my current C# development skills,
and are only to showcase how my skills developed over the years.

The C# Console application uses not Classes.
The WinForms application are the same implementation, only with WinForms

I created these C# applications to download and view Battlefield 4 Player statistics.

The C# projects have a few features included
- Automatically creating BF4 teams consisting of 5 players each.
- View and sort players based on the user preference.
- View detailed stats of players
- Add a new player to download the player's stats.
- Compare new stats to previous saved stats.
- Retrieve a list of servers.
- Detailed stats about the servers, including the current players.

I used 2 API endpoints. 

One API Endpoint are from BF4 themself.
One API Endpoint are from Battlelog.
